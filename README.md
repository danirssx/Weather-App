# Weather-App
This is my Weather App. It has an input to search the city that you want and displays a basic information of the weather and a nice background of the City/Country. I have been working on this project for some time now, and itâ€™s finally ready for public release!

It was made in Vanilla Javascript. The design with Adobe XD. <br><br>
The API for the weather was: https://www.weatherapi.com/ <br>
